## üìñ About This Series

The **Enterprise MCP Series** is an **open-source initiative** designed to help you **design, build, and deploy** modular, **production-grade AI automation systems** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

In this series, we focus on building a **Pull Request Reviewer** for an enterprise project, showcasing how to integrate multiple tools and orchestrate them into a scalable, production-ready MCP architecture.

### üéØ Why This Series?

Unlike simple tutorials, this series tackles **real-world, enterprise use cases**‚Äîlike a **Pull Request Reviewer Assistant** that analyzes GitHub PRs, pulls context from Github and Asana, and posts actionable insights to your team on Slack.

- **Automate AI workflows** within your internal systems  
- **Build scalable infrastructure** ‚Äì design workflows that support multiple automation pipelines, ready to grow with your organization  
- **Evaluate MCP for enterprise migration** ‚Äì understand if migrating your codebase to an MCP-based architecture is worth it  


### üõ† What You Will Learn

You will learn how to:

- **Build custom MCP Servers** for Slack, Asana, and GitHub to expose enterprise tools and resources  
- **Connect to external MCP servers** (e.g., GitHub Remote MCP) and integrate them seamlessly 
- **Centralize tools and prompts** into an internal **Tool Registry** (a global MCP server)  
- **Create a custom MCP Host** to orchestrate workflows (no reliance on Claude Desktop)  
- **Design and scale company-wide automation workflows**, starting with the PR Reviewer use case

 With these skills, you'll become a pro ü•∑ at building enterprise-ready AI automation systems using MCP, designing your own scalable hosts, integrating internal tools, and orchestrating intelligent workflows across your company.
